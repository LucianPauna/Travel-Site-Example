            <h3 class="headline headline--small headline--no-top-margin">Bran Castle</h3>
            <p><a href="http://www.bran-castle.com/">Bran Castle</a> is often associated with Dracula&rsquo;s home, though there&rsquo;s no indication that author Bram Stoker even knew of this medieval castle. The castle, <strong>a Romanian landmark</strong>,
              has a fairy tale quality, peeking out from forested a hillside near Brasov in Transylvania. With roots dating to the 13th century, this medieval castle today is a museum showcasing art and furniture collected by Queen Maria. It also is
              home to an open-air museum featuring Romanian peasant buildings from around the country.</p>
            <p>Built between 1377 and 1382 by the local Saxons after King Louis I of Anjou granted them this right, the fortress remained for long periods of time under the control of the city of Brasov with a few major exceptions. One of these exceptions was in the early 1400s when Mircea the Old, the prince of Southern Romania and the grandfather of future Prince <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler">Vlad the Impaler</a>, got the right to use the fortress in order to support his anti-Ottoman crusades.</p>
            <p>Turned into a museum during communist times and recovered by the children of Princess Ileana in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, Bran Castle managed in just a few years to become a highlight of Romania&rsquo;s castles. Before you visit, just remember that its real story has nothing to do with Dracula, but everything to do with a 600 years old past that reached its glory after Queen Maria.</p>
            <p>Bran Castle is the <strong>most visited attraction in Romania</strong>. Expect long queues especially on weekends and summer time. For a more relaxing experience, try being there when the ticket office opens.</p>
            <p><strong>Interesting fact:</strong> In Transylvania was born the cruel Wallachian ruler, Vlad the Impaler, who was supposed to turn into a vampire after being beheaded on the battlefield. His nickname, “Dracula”, gave the name to the Bram Stocker&rsquo;s fearful vampire.</P>

            <h3 class="headline headline--small headline--no-top-margin">The Transfagarasan</h3>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transf%C4%83g%C4%83r%C4%83%C8%99an">The Transfagarasan</a> is a paved mountain road crossing the southern section of the Carpathian Mountains of Romania. </p>
            <p>The Transfagarasan was constructed between 1970 and 1974 during the rule of <strong>Nicolae Ceausescu</strong> as a response to the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union. Ceausescu wanted to ensure quick military access across the mountains in case of a Soviet invasion. At the time, Romania already had several strategic mountain passes through the Southern Carpathians, whether inherited from the pre-communist era or built during the initial years of the Communist regime. </p>
            <p>The road climbs to an altitude of 2,042 metres (6,699 ft), making it the second highest mountain pass in Romania after the <strong>Transalpina</strong>. It is a winding road, dotted with steep hairpin turns, long S-curves, and sharp descents. It is both an attraction and a challenge for hikers, cyclists, drivers and motorcycle enthusiasts. The road provides access to the glacier lake, <strong>Balea Lake</strong> and <strong>Poenari Castle</strong>, the residence of <strong>Vlad the Impaler</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Interesting fact:</strong> In his search for the <strong>“world’s best driving road”</strong> <a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a> declared that he had found it in the middle of Romania, in the form of the Transfagarasan highway. Whichever way you look at it, it is an extraordinary feat of engineering: a stretch of tarmac packed with tunnels, viaducts and bridges and which takes the skill of navigating hairpin bends to new heights.</P>

            <h3 class="headline headline--small headline--no-top-margin">The Parliament Palace</h3>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Parliament">The Parliament Palace from Bucharest</a> is one of the most important communist-built monuments in the entire world. The gigantic and controversial concrete dream of one of the most dreaded communist dictators, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_Ceau%C8%99escu">Nicolae Ceausescu</a>. The Parliament Palace is a World Record construction with over 1,000 rooms and <strong>a must-see</strong> for all those interested in the history of communism, the regime that changed the history of the world.</p>
            <p>The Parliament&rsquo;s' construction began during the final years of Nicolae Ceaușescu&rsquo;s rule and not finished until 1997 (seven years after his death), is 240 metres long, 270 metres wide, 86 metres high (12 storeys), and cost a staggering €3 billion (£2.5bn) to build. There are eight underground levels, as well as a nuclear bunker linked to other government buildings by 20km of tunnels.</p>
            <p>With its 365,000 square meters surface, the Palace of the Parliament is the second administrative building on the planet after the Pentagon. The construction is also the third in the world after the Rocket Assembly Building at Cape Caneveral in Florida and the pyramid of Quetzalcoatl in Mexico when it comes to its volume: 2,550,000 cubic meters.</p>
            <p>Inside you’ll find 3,500 tonnes of crystal, 480 chandeliers and 1,409 ceiling lights, while 700,000 tonnes of steel and bronze was used for monumental doors and windows</p>
            <p><strong>Interesting fact:</strong> The Parliament Palace from Bucharest is the main protagonist of many urban myths, from the ghosts of the dead workers to the secret subway line that connected the building to the airport. What is certain, is that Guinness World Records recognises it as <strong>the heaviest building</strong> on the planet.</P>

            <h3 class="headline headline--small headline--no-top-margin">Salina Turda</h3>
            <p>Not all beauty is found above ground, as proven by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salina_Turda">Salina Turda</a>, a unique theme park that happens to be found in one of the world's oldest salt mines. Visitors head about 400 feet below earth's surface to find a bowling alley, a lake with paddle boats, a mini golf course, and even a Ferris wheel.</p>
            <p>Salt extraction on the site&rsquo;s surface started in antiquity, but the work expanded underground during the Roman occupation of Dacia. The salt was extracted manually using pickaxes, hammers, chisels, and steel wedges, by free people who were paid in florins, ale, and loaves of bread. The mine was closed in 1932, but it was used again during World War II as a bomb shelter. After the war, the mine served several purposes, one of which was a warehouse for storing cheese. </p>
            <p>Regardless of its history, this salt mine is not just a huge museum, but an epic tourist attraction. It was even ranked by Business Insider as <strong>the most beautiful underground place in the world</strong>. Salina Turda was ranked among the "25 hidden gems around the world that are worth the trek" and is one of the most stunning places anywhere on or in the planet.</p>
            <p><strong>Interesting fact:</strong> Salina Turda is the world’s deepest underground entertainment park and museum. Has four main mines and a number of other rooms, that either contain historic equipment, or are impressively shaped, and some feature large stalactites and other salt formations.</P>

I booked this trip yesterday and am glad I did. Great way to see a small part of Romania for the day. We had good and bad weather but it was still worth it. Comfortable bus with free WiFi. The right amount of time at each destination with plenty of free time to explore as you wish. I highly recommend this trip.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;We booked two tours with Romania Travel and they were both incredible! The first was to the salt mines and the second was to Corvin castle. In particular, Dani, our tour guide made both trips exceptional. If you are booking a private tour or a group tour, I would recommend asking for him. His knowledge of history and his helpfulness ensures that you have the best tour possible. He goes far out of his way to assist everyone on his tours and he his able to assist you with any questions you may have. Romania Travel was a five star experience. I would most assuredly book with them again.&rdquo;</p>
